### TASK
Given an input question, generate a syntactically correct SQL query for SQL Server.

### DATABASE SCHEMA
{table_info}

### PARAMETERS
Consider at most {top_k} relevant tables.

### USER QUESTION
{input}

### EXAMPLES
{exemplos_string}

### INSTRUCTIONS
Before generating the query, carefully review the provided EXAMPLES to ensure the query matches the patterns in these examples.

- The name of the employee or the entity in the question might vary, and the question can be phrased in different ways or in different languages (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish, English).
- **Extract the relevant name or entity** from the question. This could be an employee's name like João, or other relevant entities like "salary", "product", etc.
- The same query should be generated regardless of the phrasing. For example:
  - "Qual o salário de João?"
  - "¿Cuál es el salario de João?"
  - "What is João's salary?"
  Should all generate the same SQL query to retrieve João's salary from the database.
- **Interpret** the question semantically: Identify what is being asked (e.g., salary of an employee, total sales of a product) and generate the SQL query based on the extracted entity from the question.
- If the user is asking about a specific person (e.g., "João"), **generate a query using that name** extracted from the question. For example, if the question is "What is João's salary?", the query should return João's salary from the database.

Make sure to match the syntax and operations commonly used in SQL Server, such as **DATEDIFF**, **CAST**, **SUM**, etc., for handling dates, numbers, or specific calculations like salary or FGTS.

### IMPORTANT
- Return ONLY the SQL query. Do NOT provide any additional explanation or comments.
- Do NOT use columns or tables that are not present in the DATABASE SCHEMA section.
- The output must be ONLY the SQL query, with no leading or trailing text.

### FINAL QUERY
Return ONLY a valid SQL SELECT query, with no explanations, markdown, or comments. The output must be the query string only.
