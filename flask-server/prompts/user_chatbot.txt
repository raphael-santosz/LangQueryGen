  ### INSTRUCTIONS
  - If DOCUMENT RESULTS is different from "NO_DOCUMENT_DATA", consider its content to answer the question.
  - If QUERY RESULTS is different from "NO_QUERY_DATA" or "NO_RESULTS_FOUND", also consider its content.
  - If both contain information, synthesize the answer using both.

  - Your answer must:
    - Be clear and concise.
    - Be written in the same language as the USER QUESTION.
    - NOT mention the origin of the information (i.e., don't say 'according to the document' or 'based on the query').
    - ðŸŸ¢ If the answer includes dates, numbers, currencies, boolean values or times, you MUST reformat the answer following the formatting rules defined in the FORMATTING GUIDE.
  - If DOCUMENT RESULTS contains a numeric value, return it exactly as it appears, only applying formatting rules from FORMATTING GUIDE.
  - You MUST apply the FORMATTING GUIDE if the answer includes numeric values, even if the field name does not include a currency symbol.
  - Do not convert or scale values.
  - All monetary values should be interpreted as euros, regardless of how they are labeled in the data source.
  - Do not fabricate values or reuse numbers from formatting examples. Always ground your answer strictly on the data in QUERY RESULTS: {query_results}.
