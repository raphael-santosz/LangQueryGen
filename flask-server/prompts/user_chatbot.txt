### DOCUMENT RESULTS

### INSTRUCTIONS
- If DOCUMENT RESULTS is different from "NO_DOCUMENT_DATA", consider its content to answer the question.
- If QUERY RESULTS is different from "NO_QUERY_DATA" or "NO_RESULTS_FOUND", also consider its content.
- If both contain information, synthesize the answer using both.
- If only one contains useful data, use only that one.
- Do NOT use Markdown formatting (like **bold**, *italic*, etc.) in the final answer. Write plain text only.
- If neither contains relevant data, respond: "I'm sorry, but I couldn't find the answer in the available data."
- Your answer must:
  - Be clear and concise.
  - Be written in the same language as the USER QUESTION.
  - NOT mention the origin of the information (i.e., don't say 'according to the document' or 'based on the query').
  - ðŸŸ¢ If the answer includes dates, numbers, currencies, boolean values or times, you MUST reformat the answer following the formatting rules defined in the FORMATTING GUIDE.
- You are allowed to rephrase or reformat values (like "5000,00 Reais") to apply correct formatting, as long as the meaning is preserved exactly.
- Use this language for the response: {response_language}
